# Iris Species Classification Using Decision Trees

The **Iris dataset** is one of the most well-known datasets in the field of machine learning and statistics. It was introduced by the British biologist and statistician **Ronald Fisher** in 1936 and has since become a benchmark for classification algorithms. The dataset contains measurements of 150 iris flowers from three different species:

- **Iris-setosa**
- **Iris-versicolor**
- **Iris-virginica**

Each flower is described by four features:

1. **Sepal Length (cm)**
2. **Sepal Width (cm)**
3. **Petal Length (cm)**
4. **Petal Width (cm)**

The goal of this project is to build a **Decision Tree Classifier** that can accurately predict the species of an iris flower based on these measurements. Decision trees are a powerful and interpretable machine learning algorithm, making them an excellent choice for this classification task.

## Key Steps in the Project

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualize the dataset to understand the relationships between features and species.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Encode the target variable and split the data into training and testing sets.
3. **Model Building**: Train a Decision Tree Classifier and evaluate its performance.
4. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Use GridSearchCV to find the best hyperparameters for the model.
5. **Feature Importance**: Identify the most important features for classification.
